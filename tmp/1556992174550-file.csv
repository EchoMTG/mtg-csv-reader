Antarctic krill oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants (astaxanthin), and a phospholipid complex.</p><p>Heart Benefits of Krill Oil<br />CVS Health 100% Pure Omega-3 Krill contains omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA.&#160; Supportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.</p><p>Antioxidant Benefits of Krill Oil<br />Krill oil contains astaxanthin, a carotenoid, which is not seen in standard fish oil. Astaxanthin may protect you from damaging free radicals.*</p><p>Phospholipid Benefits of Krill Oil:<br />Unlike fish oils, krill oil carries omega-3s in the form of phospholipids - liposomes or little packages that deliver the fatty acids to your body's cells. Standard fish oils lack this phospholipid complex, which supports easy absorption of fatty acids.</p><p>This product comes from a fishery that has been independently certified to the MSC's standard for a well-managed and sustainable fishery. <a href=\http://www.msc.org\>www.msc.org</a></p><p>Superba2\ - Patented - Improved (1)</p><p>(1) Superba2\ is a trademark of the Aker Group.<br />*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
